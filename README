Fixi - Source Code
==================

A fixity tracker utility.

Installation
------------

You have two options:

A) Install from rubygems.org: > [sudo] gem install fixi

B) Install from source:       > [sudo] rake install

NOTE: Fixi uses sqlite3, which will need to be built if it's not already
      on your system. If you are using Ubuntu and you get an error about
      building sqlite, you may need to install both the ruby1.9.1-dev 
      and the libsqlite3-dev packages:

      > [sudo] apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev libsqlite3-dev

Usage
-----

To see usage, after installing, run fixi --help
